##' another source of experimental data is the MGI website, which has
##' a number of "panels" of mice generated in experimental work and
##' then measured, typically the crosses used are backcrosses
##' the functionality to extract all of this and the reference website
##' are in the simulationFunctions file, we start by loading the MGI
##' provided database of markers (which is rather large)
mgiMarkers <- readMGIlists() # descriptions of all markers

##' known cM position, while NAs indicate markers missing from the
##' reference file or marked as unknown there
