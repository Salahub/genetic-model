Title: Generating and Experimenting with Simulated Genomes
Description: Implements a simple model of genetics to be used as a teaching aid and sandbox for non-experts curious about the basics of genetic dynamics. The main features are the genome S3 class and basic functions that support the simulation of population genomics with user-specified mechanics. Several real data sets that record mouse genomic data are included adapted from sources at the Mouse Genome Database <https://www.informatics.jax.org/>.
